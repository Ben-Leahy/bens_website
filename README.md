# bens_website


## Software stack: 
do we want to use angluar or react for the front end? Could use react to show that I can use react and angular. 

## Plan:
Keep building out the website as I learn what to do in 2095. 
Can definitely keep ahead with things if I want, but nothing wrong with just using it as extra practice
